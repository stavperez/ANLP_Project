typical of proteins associated with cell walls of plants.', ' In addition, it is also heavily glycosylated.', ' The copper is tetrahedrally coordinated by a cysteine, 2 histidines, and a glutamine residue.', ' The glutamine residue takes place of a methione ligand typically found in other blue copper proteins.', ' In addition, electron transfer rates for stellacyanin are faster than for other type I copper proteins suggesting stellacyanin is more solvent accessible at the active site.', ' The exact function of stellacyanin is unknown.', ' However, given the fact that type I copper proteins
